$rephrased Sentence : The arm efficiency during the run can be enhanced with this drill. Start by kneeling with the left foot in front and the right knee down. Keep your glutes and hamstrings engaged by applying pressure through the front heel. To begin, block the arms in long, pendulum-like swings. Gradually close the arm angle, using the arms to block as you would do while jogging, and eventually progress to a run and then a sprint. Once your hands go past the hip, swiftly accelerate them forward during the sprinting motion to achieve maximum speed. Switch knees and repeat the process.

$rephrased Sentence : Please secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and gradually lay down on it.
Begin by using a close grip, which is slightly narrower than shoulder width, to lift the bar from the rack and hold it directly over you with your arms locked and elbows in. Your arms should form a right angle with the floor. Remember, it is advisable to have a spotter assist you in lifting the barbell to protect your rotator cuff.
Now slowly lower the bar to your lower chest while inhaling, ensuring that your elbows stay close to your body.
Using your triceps, push the bar back up to the starting position while exhaling.
While inhaling, keep your upper arms still and slowly bring the bar down towards you in a semicircular motion until you feel a slight touch on your forehead. 
Exhale and lift the bar back to the starting position by contracting your triceps.
Continue repeating steps 3-6 until you have completed the recommended number of repetitions.
