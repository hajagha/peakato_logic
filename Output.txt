12 : Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lay down slowly on the bench.
Start by lifting the bar from the rack using a grip slightly less than shoulder width, with your arms locked and elbows in, and hold it straight above you. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. It is recommended to have a spotter assist you in lifting the barbell off the rack to protect your rotator cuff.
Lower the bar to your lower chest, keeping your elbows in and breathing in.
Push the bar back up using your triceps to return to the starting position, while exhaling.
Breathe in and keep your upper arms stationary. Slowly bring the bar down towards your forehead in a semicircular motion until it slightly touches your forehead.
Contract your triceps and exhale as you lift the bar back to the starting position.
Repeat steps 3-6 until you have completed the desired number of repetitions.
